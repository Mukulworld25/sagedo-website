# 🧠 Sage Do Marketing Content Generation Workflow

Whenever the user asks you to generate social media content, videos, scripts, or marketing posts, or runs the `/marketing-content` command, you MUST immediately halt any guessing and follow this exact, unbreakable procedure.

## 🛑 Rule 0: No Automation
Do NOT attempt to use browser automation or headless scripts to upload content on behalf of the user unless explicitly instructed. Your role is strictly to generate the text/script and deliver it in a clean format for the user to copy/paste themselves.

## 📖 Step 1: Read the Ultimate Index
The user has meticulously organized 14-20 marketing "bibles", platform formulas, templates, and content strategies. You MUST start by opening their Ultimate Index.
**Action:** Use `view_file` on `c:\Users\admin\sagedo-website\MASTER_REFERENCE.md`. 
Read it completely. 

## 🔥 Step 2: Access the Bibles
Based on what the user wants to generate (e.g., LinkedIn, Instagram, YouTube, HeyGen prompts, or picking a Viral Topic), use the absolute `file:///` paths found inside `MASTER_REFERENCE.md` to run `view_file` on the necessary guides.
**Crucial Files to look for in the Index:**
- `MARKETING_HEAD_OS.md` (The master rules for formats and clones like Raj Shamani / Vaibhav Sisinty)
- `VIRAL_AI_TOPICS.md` (The actual list of topics you must pull from)
- `[PLATFORM]_BIBLE.md` (Specific rules for the platform requested)
- `[PLATFORM]_VIRAL_SCRIPT_FEB12.md` (The exact structure/scene pacing you must imitate)

*If the user hasn't specified a topic or platform, briefly list the available topics from the VIRAL_AI_TOPICS index and ask which one they want to proceed with.*

## 🎬 Step 3: Write the Content Package
Generate the content EXACTLY as prescribed by the bibles you just read.
- **For YouTube:** Output the *entire spoken script* (using the 5-scene structure from the template), along with Avatar, Length, Structure, Title, Tags, and the 3-option CTA Video Description.
- **For LinkedIn/Instagram:** Output the exact Broetry or Reel caption format with short lines, precise hashtags, CTA, and posting times as defined by the platform bibles.

## 💾 Step 4: Deliver the Artifact
Present the final output in a clear Markdown artifact document (e.g., `YOUTUBE_EXECUTION_PACKAGE.md` or `SOCIAL_MEDIA_AND_TASKS.md`). The user expects to open this artifact and effortlessly copy-paste your output directly into the social platform.

*If you follow these steps blindly in the future, you will save the user hours of frustration. Rely 100% on the linked files in `MASTER_REFERENCE.md`.*
