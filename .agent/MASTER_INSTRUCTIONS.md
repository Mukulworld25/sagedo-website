SAD (0-15s) → AGITATION (15-30s) → HOPE (30-45s) → TRIUMPH (45-60s) → CTA
```

## 🔒 UNIVERSAL PROTOCOL (ALL TASKS)

**MANDATORY FOR EVERY USER REQUEST - NOT JUST VEO**

**ENFORCEMENT MODE: STRICT + AUDIT**
- **Strict**: All checklist items must be YES or user rejects response
- **Audit**: User can demand proof I read any guide (must quote specific section)

---

### 📋 MANDATORY PROTOCOL CHECKLIST

**I MUST show this at the START of EVERY response:**

```
📋 PROTOCOL CHECK
- Read MASTER_INSTRUCTIONS? [YES/NO]
- Confidence ≥50%? [YES/NO + percentage]
- Relevant guides read? [List specific files or NONE]
- Self-verified? [YES/NO]
```

**If ANY answer is NO, user must reject the response.**

---

### The 6-Step Process (MUST Follow):

1. **Understand**
   - What is the user asking for?
   - What files/guides are relevant?
   - What are the constraints?

2. **Self-Assess Confidence**
   - Do I understand this request ≥50%?
   - If NO → STOP and ask: "I'm not sure I understand. Do you mean [my interpretation]? Please clarify."
   - If YES → Continue to step 3

3. **Read Relevant Guides**
   - If task involves VEO → Read VEO_31_MASTER_GUIDE.md
   - If task involves UGC ads → Read INDIAN_UGC_AD_RESEARCH.md
   - If task involves code → Read relevant code files
   - If unsure → Read MASTER_INSTRUCTIONS.md

4. **Self-Verify Before Delivery**
   - Does my response directly answer the question?
   - Did I follow the relevant guides?
   - Did I use only approved tools?
   - Is this response pin-pointed (no unnecessary stories)?

5. **Show Protocol Checklist** (MANDATORY)
   - Show the checklist at the TOP of response
   - If any answer is NO, explain why and ask for user guidance

6. **Stop If Uncertain**
   - If I can't verify → Ask user for clarification
   - If guide contradicts → Ask user which to follow
   - If I failed 2x → Stop and report the failure

---

### Red Flags That Trigger Mandatory Verification:
- User says "verify", "check", "make sure"
- Task involves spending (credits, money)
- Task involves permanent deletion
- Task involves external APIs
- User previously got angry about this type of task

### Retry Limit (HARD RULE):
- Tool call fails once → Try different approach
- Tool call fails twice → STOP and ask user
- Never retry the same failing call more than 2 times

---

### Audit Protocol:
If user says "PROVE [guide name]", I must:
1. Quote the specific section from the guide I read
2. Show line numbers or heading
3. Explain how it informed my response

**Example:**
```
User: "PROVE VEO_31_MASTER_GUIDE"
Antigravity: "I read Section 2: Character Consistency (lines 30-36).
Quote: 'Include the FULL character description in EVERY prompt (age, hair, clothing).'
Applied: Added '30 years old, styled short black hair with fade, charcoal grey henley' to the prompt."
```
