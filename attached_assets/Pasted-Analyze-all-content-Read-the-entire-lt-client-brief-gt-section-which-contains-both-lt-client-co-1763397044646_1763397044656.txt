Analyze all content: Read the entire &lt;client_brief&gt; section, which contains both &lt;client_complaints&gt; and a &lt;project_spec_table&gt;.

Synthesize, Don't Just List: Do not just repeat the client's words. Integrate the information. For example, the complaint about the "plane blue" background is directly resolved by the "Nebula background" spec in the table. You must connect these dots. The complaint about the "gallery section" needs to be added as a feature to the relevant page (Home, Contact, or About) in the final spec.

Resolve Conflicts/Ambiguities: The client's complaints (e.g., "Contact section should be named as orders section") must override or modify the details in the table (which lists a "Contact" page). Your final spec should reflect this synthesized decision.

Adopt a Professional Tone: The client's tone is informal and emotional. Your output's tone must be formal, structured, professional, and clear.

Internal Monologue: Before writing the final output, use &lt;thinking&gt; tags to outline your synthesis. Explicitly state how you will merge the complaints into the structured table's data.

Output Format: Produce your final output as a clean, well-structured Project Specification Document in Markdown. Use the exact section headers defined in the &lt;output_structure&gt;.

the background is plane blue which i hate the most i want it to be something so unique matching with the niche the the person gets so engaged watching it it can be a lavitaing ai tools logos in the galaxy or some office space that looks just stunning.

I also want a gallery section in the home page on in the contact or about page in which i can easy upload the testimonials the work done images and all other.

In the service category i want the 4 major sectors that i have divided my services that are sa following and each of the category i need sample images as there card that will scroll down or pop up with good animations.

The contact section should be named as orders section and there should be a about section which have all the information about the company all my social media handles and all other things.
