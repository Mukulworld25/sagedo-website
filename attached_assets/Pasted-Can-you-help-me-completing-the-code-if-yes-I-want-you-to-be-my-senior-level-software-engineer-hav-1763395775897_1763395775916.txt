Can you help me completing the code? if yes , I want you to be my senior level software engineer having 20+ years in web development for big mncs like google amazon apple etc.
I want you read the text fine i have attached to give you the gist.

1 its already in the files of this project folder also have attached it, 2- i want it definitely.   3- i want it and also the code i have given to you its incomplete. because the limit was ended up in between and the chat is now saying that i have to initiate a new chat also there is a lot of mistakes like the top admin copyright section should be in bottom and the namaste baton should be on the top.

***Project Status Report: SAGEDO AI Website v2.0
To: The SAGEDO AI Team From: Lead Project Assistant Date: 17 November 2025 Subject: Summary of v2.0 Build, Key Fixes, and Immediate Next Steps

This report summarizes the critical technical overhaul of the SAGEDO AI website. We have successfully addressed major security and functionality gaps and have now integrated a complete, production-ready "serverless" backend.

1. What We Have Done
We have just completed a significant development sprint, migrating the website from a non-functional prototype to a fully operational, single-file application.

Identified Critical Security Flaws: The original site's token and "Golden Ticket" system ran entirely in the browser's localStorage. This was critically insecure, as any user could manually edit their token balance.

Implemented a Secure "Vibe Coder" Stack: To support the non-technical "vibe coding" requirement, we've integrated a robust, zero-cost backend stack:

Email Notifications: EmailJS is integrated for all form submissions.

File Storage: Cloudinary is integrated for all file uploads.

Database/Forms: Netlify Forms and localStorage are used in combination for secure order and state management.

Chat: A WhatsApp floating button is integrated for direct contact.

Activated All Core Functionality: The following features are now coded and functional:

Order Form: Successfully captures all user data.

Admin Dashboard: A private admin panel is now active (accessible from the footer) to view and manage all incoming orders.

Order Tracking: A functional, 4-stage tracking system (Pending, Processing, Finalizing, Delivered) is live for customers.

Integrated Live Credentials: We have successfully embedded all necessary API keys and credentials provided into the final code:

Netlify URL: sagedoai.netlify.app

EmailJS: service_Sagedo00, template_sagedo01, and Public Key tOl_VEndfPKrAKUtX. All notifications will go to sagedoai00@gmail.com.

Cloudinary: sagedo_uploads preset is configured.

WhatsApp: +91 7018709291 is linked.

Resolved Deployment Blocker: The primary issue preventing progress was the code file being truncated (cut off) in our chat interface due to its length. We have resolved this by providing the complete code in three distinct parts, which have now been successfully assembled into a single, complete index.html file.

2. Why We Have Done This
The goal was to build a website that is not only visually impressive but also secure and automated.

To Prevent Fraud: The security fixes were non-negotiable. We had to prevent users from abusing the rewards system, which is now achieved with rate-limiting and secure state handling.

To Automate the Business: The previous site was a "dead" page. The new system immediately notifies the admin via email (sagedoai00@gmail.com) and WhatsApp upon a new order, allowing for real-time response.

To Enable Zero-Cost Operation: The chosen "serverless" stack is free at our current scale, fulfilling the core business requirement of a ₹0 operational cost.

3. What We Are Going to Do Further (Immediate Next Steps)
The new, complete index.html file is now assembled and ready. The project is 99% complete. The following steps are required to go live.

Final Deployment (Critical): The absolute next step is to deploy the newly assembled, complete index.html file to Netlify. This will overwrite the old, broken version and push the new, functional site live.

End-to-End (E2E) Testing: Immediately following deployment, we must conduct a full test to confirm all integrations are working.

Test Checklist:

Submit a Test Order: Fill out the "Orders" form with a test file.

Check Admin Email: Confirm the new order notification arrives at sagedoai00@gmail.com.

Check Admin Dashboard: Log in to the Admin panel and verify the new order appears with "Pending" status.

Check Cloudinary: Log in to Cloudinary and confirm the test file was successfully uploaded.

Check Order Tracking: Use the new Order ID to check the "Track" page.

Pending: Payment Integration: The Razorpay integration is coded but on hold, as we are waiting for your account verification to be approved. The site can launch and accept orders without it, as payments will be handled manually via WhatsApp/email in the interim.
